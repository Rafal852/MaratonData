# 100 Mile Race Data Analysis

Created simply for me to check out **Looker**, and the process of creating a dashboard there.

## About

- **Data source:** Results from a real 100 mile race.
- **Analysis tool:** Looker was used to explore and visualize the race data. Data was cleaned in Python, and simple EDA in SQL was carried.

## Files

- `ff_race_100.csv` — Raw race results (places, names, times, etc.)
- `clean_ff_race_100_output.csv` — Cleaned and enriched data with extra fields (e.g. total minutes, coordinates)
- `ff_looker_100.xlsx` — Excel version of the data for easier exploration
- `Marathon_dashboard_looker.pdf` — Example dashboard exported from Looker
- `explo_marath.sql` -contains simple queries for exploring and summarizing the 100 mile race dataset.
